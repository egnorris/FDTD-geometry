    "## About ##\n",
    "This tool is for creating an arbitrary geometry for use in with the University of Ottawa computational nanophotonics lab's in house 3D-FDTD code. It takes in an image file and processes it into compatible geometry file by using a method similar to a 1D additive manufacturing process, where the image is analyzed to find the coordinates of each pixel of the material's perimeter, using this list the positions and widths of single pixel long rectangles is compiled into a list and processed into the previously mentioned compatible geometry.json file needed by the 3D-FDTD code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements ##\n",
    "To use this code you will need both an image that fits the below requirements and a copy of the appropriate pphinfoini.json file that controls the FDTD simulation. a template of this file should be included in this repository but I will also include the format for that file below. If you are using multiple materials then a material_configuration.json file is also needed, details below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Image Format ###\n",
    "For the best results a vector graphics program, such as the open source inkscape (https://inkscape.org/), should be used. A vector graphics program will allow for the precise placement of image elements. The image measurements should be in pixels, and the output image size should match the pixel count of the image in the workspace. if you are unsure of the dimensions of the output image this code will display the number of pixels of the input image file. Though this code has only been tested with PNG files only light testing of the initial image read-in function would need to be conducted to validate for TIFF and JPEG files. For the analsis to work correcty the image needs to have at least one pixel of empty space around the perimeter and the processor, which will be described within the code, expects that material corresponds to a black pixel (colors are converted to grayscale) and white pixels correspond to the background material (depends on the ini file, but by default it's vaccuum unless the \"First Medium\", \"Middle Medium\", or \"Last Medium\" keys are utilized). Make sure that the width and length of the image matche the first and last element of the \"Domain Size\" key respectively. Colors are allowed, but the bit depth will be flattened to 2 colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### material_configuration.json ###\n",
    "Multiple materials can be placed in the same geometry file, based on this json input file, if this file is not included the below information will be used by default. A material entry includes the  layer material, the thickness, the y-position of the center point, and where the code needs to look for the image file. The thickness defines how thick every block of the material will be along the propagation direction, in this case the y-axis, and the y-placement specifies exactly where in the y-axis this material layer will be centered. In the case of multiple materials each entry should be formatted as below, with additional entries enclosed by curly braces and separated by a comma, if any entries in the subsequent elements are left blank, then the information from the first material will be used\n",
